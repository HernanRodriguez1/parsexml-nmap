# parsexml-nmap

parsexml-nmap allows you to extract XML data from tools such as nmap, rustscan, masscan, etc. that output "addr" "portid" tags in CSV.
The added value of parsexml-nmap is the scan menu that allows queries from any host that is in the exported file.

## Information

```sh
    1- PortSYN Scan -sS: Scanning TCP ports using SYN packets. Useful for discovering services without being intrusive."
    2- PortTCP Scan -sT: Scanning TCP ports using full connections. Useful for stealth scanning, but slower."
    3- PortUDP Scan -sU: UDP port scanning for less common services. It can be slow and less reliable."
    4- Null scan -sN: Null scan that does not set flags in the packet. Useful for evading certain firewall defenses."
    5- FIN scan -sF: Scan that sets the FIN flag in the packet. Useful for evading certain firewall defenses."
    6- OS Analysis and Version Discovery -O -sV: Detects the operating system and version of the service. Useful for detailed information."
    7- Nmap Script Engineering default: Runs the default Nmap scripts to detect vulnerabilities and additional services."
    8- Firewall Bypass --script=firewall-bypass: Run an Nmap script to try to bypass firewalls."
    9- Bypass Script --script=firewall-bypass: Run an Nmap script to try to bypass firewalls."
    10- Data Length --data-length <number>: Specifies the custom data length in packets. It may confuse IDS/IPS."
    11- Smash -ff: Fragments packets to evade IDS/IPS detection."
    12- ACK scan -sA: ACK scan that verifies if the ports are open or filtered by a firewall."
    13- Xmas Tree scan -sX: Xmas Tree scan that sets multiple flags in the packet. Useful for evading firewall defenses."
    14- ICMP Echo scan -PE: ICMP Echo Request scan to discover active hosts."
    15- UDP scan -sU: Scanning UDP ports for less common services. It can be slow and less reliable."
    16- IP Protocol scan -sO: Scanning of IP protocols used in the network."
    17- RPC scan -sR: RPC Remote Procedure Call scan to discover RPC services."
    18- IDLE scan -sI: IDLE scan that uses a zombie host technique to evade detection."
    19- FTP Bounce scan -b: FTP bounce scan that uses FTP servers to perform indirect scans."
    20- ICMP Timestamp scan -D: ICMP Timestamp scan that uses ICMP packets to obtain response time information from hosts and evade some firewall defenses.
```

## Rustscan

```sh
rustscan -u 2000 -a 192.168.100.13 -- -oX rustscan.xml
```

We can perform a proof of concept of enumeration with nmap using the 20 options, choosing the host from the XML file generated by the tools: nmap, masscan, rustscan, etc. that are compatible with the tags described above.

```sh
sudo python3 parse-nmap.py
```
